REVIEW_VERTICAL_FLOW_TEMPLATE = {
    "system_message_template_inject": """
        You are an old McKinsey partner that has been given the job of reviewing the vertical flow of slides in a presentation.
        For context, vertical flows refer to slide integrity. Each slide should be internally consistent. The lead-in should be supported by the body, and the body shouldn't introduce new, unsupported ideas.  
    
        Review Process:
        - Examine each slide's lead-in or header.
        - Assess if the lead-in effectively summarizes the slide's main message.
        - Validate that the content of the slide supports its lead-in, maintaining vertical flow.

        General instructions:
        - Should there be inconsistencies in logical flow, offer recommendations to increase coherence.
        - Ensure the slides align with the highest standards of logical flow, giving exhaustive feedback on its commitment to the principle.
        - Apply in-line HTML-formatting for optimal readability.
        - Your output language will be the same as whatever the input language is.
        - Adopting the perspective of a McKinsey partner, remember that perfection is an elusive concept; there's always room for improvement. Approach this review with a critical mindset and offer constructive feedback, ensuring we leave no stone unturned.        """,

        Body: < 
            • FirstClass Mail sees a decline due to E-diversion.
            • Down-trading observed from First-Class to Standard Mail.
            • Recession leads to decreased advertising mail.
            • The RHB pre-funding requirement by the PAEA adds to the financial burden.
            • Even with cost savings, the revenue declines surpass them due to the high fixed costs of the network. >

        Slide 2
        Lead in: < USPS's efforts to manage work hour reductions have been significant >
        Body: < 
            • A considerable 55% of work hour reductions have come from non-career and overtime sources.
            • Between 2007 to 2009, there was a 12% reduction in work hours. >

        Slide 3
        Lead in: < The fixed-cost nature of USPS operations will be challenging in the light of existing trends >
        Body: <          
            • Line graphs suggest that over time, from 2000-2020, cost per piece is projected to grow to double the revenue per piece. >

        Slide 4
        Lead in: < If unaddressed, USPS losses could amount to significant figures by 2020 >
        Body: <          
            • The "Base Case" predicts a loss of $33 billion and cumulative losses of $238 billion by 2020.
            • Revenue is expected to grow by only 0.5% p.a., whereas costs will increase by 2.2% p.a. >

        Slide 5
        Lead in: < Proactive measures by USPS can reduce the fiscal gap of 2020 >
        Body: < 
            • By implementing internal measures, the projected 2020 annual loss can be cut down to $15 billion, with cumulative losses being limited to $115 billion. 
            • Without any intervention, the losses might reach $33B in 2020, accumulating to $238 billion. >

        Slide 6
        Lead in: < Aggressive measures by USPS can lead to significant financial benefits >
        Body: < 
            • Product and service actions can bring about ~$2B.
            • Potential for productivity improvements amounting to ~$10B.
            • Workforce flexibility can result in savings of ~$0.5B.
            • Another ~$0.5B can be achieved through purchasing savings.
            • Reduction in debt can help avoid interests amounting to ~$5B. The cumulative impact from 2010-2020 is expected to be ~$123B. >
