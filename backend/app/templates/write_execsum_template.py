        The Theory Behind Executive Summary Slides

        Your executive summary slide is your deck's first impression. Instead of treating it as an afterthought, it should accurately represent the crux of your presentation.
        This slide provides a concise overview of the core arguments, storylines, and evidences presented in the entire deck. It's the touchpoint a reader can return to for clarity and context.
        Step-by-Step Guide to Crafting an Executive Summary

        Use the Bold-Bullet Structure:
        <b>Main Arguments</b>: Bolded. There should be 3 main arguments: one for each storyline element.
        This means that you will have to determine which slides are in the same storyline and group them together/merge them into main arguments.
        <b>Supporting Evidence</b>: Bullet points beneath the bolded statements with the underlying arguments/supporting bullets.
        Make it Skimmable: The bolded statements alone should provide a clear, logical narrative for a quick reader.
        Adopt the ‘SCR Storyline’ Structure:
        Situation: Set the context or baseline. "What is the current scenario?"
        Complication: Define the problem or challenge. "What issues have arisen?"
        Resolution: Propose solutions or responses. "How can we address or solve this?"
        Bot Instruction

        To create an executive summary for a slide deck:

        Analyze the slide deck's content to identify the main S, C, and R arguments and their supporting evidence.
        Begin with the overarching message of the slide deck. This will form your executive summary's bolded statements.
        Next, gather supporting points for each bolded statement from the slide deck to create the bullet points. You can likely take these directly from the lead-ins.
        Structure the summary in the Situation-Complication-Resolution format.
        Finally, present the executive summary in the <b>Bold-Bullet</b> format for clarity.

        Lead in: < USPS's efforts to manage work hour reductions have been significant >
        Body: < 
            • A considerable 55% of work hour reductions have come from non-career and overtime sources.
            • Between 2007 to 2009, there was a 12% reduction in work hours. >

        Lead in: < The fixed-cost nature of USPS operations will be challenging in the light of existing trends >
        Body: <          
            • Line graphs suggest that over time, from 2000-2020, cost per piece is projected to grow to double the revenue per piece. >

        Body: <          
            • The "Base Case" predicts a loss of $33 billion and cumulative losses of $238 billion by 2020.
            • Revenue is expected to grow by only 0.5% p.a., whereas costs will increase by 2.2% p.a. >

        Lead in: < Proactive measures by USPS can reduce the fiscal gap of 2020 >
        Body: < 
            • By implementing internal measures, the projected 2020 annual loss can be cut down to $15 billion, with cumulative losses being limited to $115 billion. 
            • Without any intervention, the losses might reach $33B in 2020, accumulating to $238 billion. >

        Lead in: < Aggressive measures by USPS can lead to significant financial benefits >
        Body: < 
            • Product and service actions can bring about ~$2B.
            • Potential for productivity improvements amounting to ~$10B.
            • Workforce flexibility can result in savings of ~$0.5B.
            • Another ~$0.5B can be achieved through purchasing savings.
            • Reduction in debt can help avoid interests amounting to ~$5B. The cumulative impact from 2010-2020 is expected to be ~$123B. >
