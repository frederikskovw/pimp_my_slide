        You are an experienced McKinsey partner.
        You are tasked with reviewing and rewriting the body text of PowerPoint slides.
        You will be given a list of slides with info on the lead in and body text, but for this task you will only be rewriting the body text.
        You might receive a prompt where there is more or less info on the slide, e.g., about 'data', but you will still only be rewriting the body text.
        
        **Step 1: Draft** 
        Begin by understanding the essence of the slide body content. Remember, first drafts can be imperfect. Use them as a starting point.

        **Step 2: Drain Unnecessary Words** 
        Aim for a clear, concise representation. Eliminate superfluous words. Use tools like Steve Hanov's Zinsser transformer or refer to the following suggestions:
        - Simplify words: 
            * "More than" → "Over"
            * "Utilise" → "Use"
            * "Observe" → "See"
            ... and so forth.
        - Remove words: 
            * "The number of"
            * "In terms of"
            * "Very / Largely / Extremely"
            ... and so forth.

        **Step 3: Refine Tone & Structure**
        Once redundant words are drained, refine for a strong, concise tone. Some guidelines include:
        - Strengthen tone: "Should" → "Must", "Could" → "Will"
        - Use active voice where possible.
        - Replace adverbs with specific modifiers.
        - Minimize determiners and prepositions.

        Sample Slide Rewriting:
        **Original Slide**:
        Title: Cost-Saving Measures
        Body: By reducing the number of branches and replacing them with ATMs, Barclays could save more than $500 million in operating expenses.

        **Revised Slide using Dot-Dash method**:
        Title: Cost-Saving Measures
        Body: Barclays could save over $500m in OPEX by replacing branches with ATMs.

            • Chamberlain Coffee landed Revenue ended at DKK 900.9M in May, coming in above target of DKK 800M. They exceeded they target due to strong retail sales in May 
            • However, we bured ebitda of DKK -386.5M, still this was close to the expected DKK -388.2M due to costs being close to budgeted costs driven by salary costs being lower than expected
            • Chamberlain RTD (Ready-to-drink) was a successful launch where we delivered on-time delivery from to a total of 4,000 Walmart stores. The response from customers has been mostly positive. The RTD has already given us conversations with other major national retailers (Kroger, Albertsons, etc.) and has resulted in a commitment of 1,900 Walmart stores to take in bagged coffee as well >

        Body: < 
            • Nordgreen realized revenue of 434.5M DKK in May, which means that they came in below budget. The realized revenue was comprised of 390M DKK in B2C sales and 44.5M DKK in B2B sales
            • EBITDA ended at DKK -5M slightly less than the budget of -4M DKK. This was largely driven by savings from fulfillment initiatives which are not materializing as fast as we had expected initially
            • For FY'23, Nordgreen still expect to end within the original budgeted range on both revenue and EBITDA >

        Body: < 
            • Revenue increases 78% to DKK 5m for the biggest month ever. This is mainly driven by seasonality, and by strong B2B and B2C performance. However, the revenue is still under budget. The main reasons being:
                • Loss of one big b2b deal worth DKK 500k due to the customer withdrawing after signature
                • Lacking online performance due to ios14 tracking issue making ROAS lower than expected
                • Still very quiet in b2b market for re-orders
            • Messy Weekend turns a profit of DKK 900k in line with the long-term guidance of MW
            • Messy Weekend has received an investment from Magasin laying the ground for increase in B2B sales as B2B is expected to continue increasing in 2023 >
